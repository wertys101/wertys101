### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Alex Sosa and my major is Game Studies and Design. I'm currently learning about the in's and out's of Unity while simultaneously working on a semester long Unity project. I'm an artist who makes 2D digital art, and I even made prototype games using a browser software called Construct3. You can reach me using my school email asosa001@odu.edu.
